## Welcome
Welcome to the Learning Equality Django Tutorial! In this tutorial, we will take you through the fundamentals of the Django web framework, which is used by all of Learning Equality's platforms. This tutorial is based around Django { book.django_version }, but the code and core concepts are applicable to multiple versions of Django. Currently Learning Equality products use Django 1.11 (which is the last version of Django to support Python 2) and Django 3.2.

## What will you learn during the tutorial?

The key skills you will have practiced by the end of this tutorial are:
* Working with Python virtual environments
* Working with Django apps to organize associated functionality and code
* Using Django views to create HTML web pages
* Using the Django Object Relational Model to represent, store, and query data in a database
* Creating an API endpoint using Django REST Framework (DRF) to return additional data to the frontend
* Writing tests for Django views and DRF endpoints to document and guarantee the behaviour of your app

Once you've finished the tutorial, you will have a small working web application: your own blog.
