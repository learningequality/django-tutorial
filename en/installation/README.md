# Installation
In this tutorial you will be building a blog. In order to do that, as you go through the tutorial you'll be instructed on how to install various software on your computer and set up some online accounts as they are needed. This page gathers all of the installation and sign-up instructions in one place (which is useful for some workshop formats).

# Brief intro to the command line {#command-line}
Many of the steps below reference the "console", "terminal", "command window", or "command line" -- these all mean the same thing: a window on your computer where you can enter commands. When you get to the main tutorial, you'll learn more about the command line. For now, the main thing you need to know is how to open a command window and what it looks like:
{% include "/intro_to_command_line/open_instructions.md" %}

# Install Git {#git}
{% include "/share/install_git.md" %}

# Install Python {#python}
{% include "/python_installation/instructions.md" %}

# Install a code editor {#code-editor}
{% include "/code_editor/instructions.md" %}

# Set up virtualenv and install Django {#virtualenv}
{% include "/django_installation/instructions.md" %}

# Create a GitHub account {#github-account}
If you do not have a Github account, go to [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com) and sign up for a new, free user account. Be sure to remember your password (add it to your password manager, if you use one).
